FEEDBACK:

Overall, well done in sticking to it this quarter.


For future, consider sharing your data in plain-text (as you have done), a spreadsheet
   format such as a CSV file. It is difficult to see the small charts within 
   the pdf_table PDF file.


Good description of findings in Explanation.txt file.
    Yes your question of average recursion limit would have been
	excellent for the discussion forum.
	Perhaps consider posting an open-ended question that you have in your future courses.
	
	
-1.5 Missing annotations on graph as required by project description:
  "annotate the graph with your findings (such as optimal recursion limit);"
This means manually circling and adding comments..‚Äù

   Where is the optimal recursion limit (range) on your graph?

-Bita.
