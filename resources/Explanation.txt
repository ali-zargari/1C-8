[Time_vs_Recursion.JPG]
There are lots of fluctuation all throughout my graphs. The volatility is most likely due to me running other apps
while the test ran, which makes sense.

The graphs all reach their lowest time index around 25 recursion limits. After that, all of the graphs will trend up
the time index graph.

[TvRL_[250, 300]]
I noticed was that as recursion limit gets closer to 300, the graphs are all trending up, but
there seems to be a correction at the very end, because most of the graphs are going down. My guess is that if I ran more
iterations till 350, or 400 for example, the drop would mean nothing and will be corrected. But I find it curious that almost all of the
graphs trend down at very specific points, like at the very beginning, or around 215.


The run time for this program was painfully long, and I did not get to test it as many times as I would ideally want. I have
a very nice 16 threaded CPU that probably helped me smoothly finish this test run in about 2 hours and 30 minutes. I am very
curious to know what the average runtime for this program was in this class.
